# Neural-Collaborative-Filtering
Pytorch implementation of Neural Collaborative Filtering
dataset_builder will create a csv with book_book pairs and a csv with userid_book pairs, this is what I think we should use 
so tha while training we won't have to randomly pick pairs which will slow things down. I am not sure this is feasible with the large dataset though.
